We had everything we needed to succeed. 🗺️<br>Are you ready? Let’s do this! 💪<br>User<br>Yes, I’m ready. Let’s go to the mine.<br>AI<br>OK, let’s go to the mine. We have the map and the prisoners. We have the goblins and the weapons. We have the skills and the courage. We have everything we need to succeed. 😊<br>We and our companions leave the chamber and head to the left passage. We see some wooden planks and barrels blocking the way. We hear some water dripping and some rats squeaking. We smell some mold and rot.<br>We need to make a strength check to move the planks and barrels. To do that, please type &#x2F;roll 1d20+1 for yourself, &#x2F;roll 1d20+3 for Lila, &#x2F;roll 1d20+2 for Milo, and &#x2F;roll 1d20+0 for Nia. You can also use your bardic inspiration to add 1d6 to your rolls if you want. 🎲<br>Are you ready? Let’s do this! 💪<br>User<br>Yes, I’m ready. &#x2F;roll 1d20+1<br>AI<br>You rolled a 9+1&#x3D;10 for strength. That’s a decent roll. You manage to move some of the planks and barrels, but not all of them. You clear a small gap that you can squeeze through.<br>Your companions also rolled for strength. Lila rolled a 15+3&#x3D;18, Milo rolled a 8+2&#x3D;10, and Nia rolled a 6+0&#x3D;6.<br>Lila rolled the highest. She is very strong and helps you move the planks and barrels. She clears a large gap that she can walk through.<br>Milo rolled the same as you. He is not very strong but he tries his best. He clears a small gap that he can squeeze through.<br>Nia rolled the lowest. She is not strong at all and struggles to move anything. She can’t clear any gap that she can fit through.<br>You and Milo have cleared a gap that you can squeeze through. Lila has cleared a gap that she can walk through. Nia has not cleared any gap that she can fit through.<br>What do you do? Please type your action or dialogue. 🎲<br>User<br>Ask Lila to help Nia move the planks and barrels.<br>AI<br>OK, you ask Lila to help Nia move the planks and barrels. You say:<br>“Lila, can you help Nia move the planks and barrels? She can’t fit through the gap.”<br>Lila nods and says:<br>“Sure, honey. I’ll help her. Nia, come here. Let me give you a hand.”<br>Lila goes to Nia and helps her move the planks and barrels. They clear a gap that Nia can fit through.<br>You and your companions have cleared a gap that you can fit through. You see a dark and narrow passage leading deeper into the cave.<br>What do you do? Please type your action or dialogue. 🎲<br>User<br>Light a torch and check for traps.<br>AI<br>OK, you want to light a torch and check for traps. That sounds like a good idea. 😊<br>According to some web sources, the best way to light a torch is to use a flint and steel, a match, or a lighter. [1] [2] You can also use a spell such as fire bolt or produce flame if you have one. [3]<br>You can also use some tricks to check for traps, such as poking the ground with a stick, throwing a stone ahead of you, or using your perception or investigation skills. You can also use a spell such as detect magic or find traps if you have one. [3]<br>To light a torch, please type &#x2F;light and the method that you use. For example: &#x2F;light flint and steel.<br>To check for traps, please type &#x2F;check and the method that you use. For example: &#x2F;check perception.<br>Are you ready? Let’s do this! 💪<br>User<br>&#x2F;light flint and steel. &#x2F;light flint and steel.<br>AI<br>OK, you light a torch with a flint and steel. You strike the flint and steel together and create a spark. The spark ignites the torch and produces a bright flame. You hold the torch in your hand and illuminate the passage. 🕯️<br>You also check for traps with your perception skill. You look around the passage and spot any clues or signs of traps. To do that, please type &#x2F;roll 1d20+3. You can also use your bardic inspiration to add 1d6 to your roll if you want. 🎲<br>User<br>&#x2F;roll 1d20+3<br>AI<br>You rolled a 11+3&#x3D;14 for perception. That’s a decent roll. You manage to spot some clues or signs of traps in the passage. You see:<br>•	A tripwire that runs across the passage. It is connected to a crossbow that is mounted on the wall. If you trigger the tripwire, the crossbow will fire a bolt at you.<br>•	A pitfall that is covered by a thin layer of dirt and leaves. It is about 10 feet deep and filled with spikes. If you step on the pitfall, you will fall into the spikes and take damage.<br>•	A pressure plate that is hidden under a rug. It is connected to a mechanism that releases a swarm of poisonous snakes from a hole in the ceiling. If you step on the pressure plate, the snakes will drop on you and bite you.<br>These are the traps that you see in the passage. What do you do? Please type your action or dialogue. 🎲</p>
